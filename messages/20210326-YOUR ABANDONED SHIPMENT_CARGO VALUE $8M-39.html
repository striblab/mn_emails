<P><BR>YOUR ABANDONED SHIPMENT/CARGO VALUE $8M</P>
<P>Dear owner</P>
<P>I am Mr. Paul Whitaker, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service<BR>Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson<BR>International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I<BR>discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom<BR>which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in<BR>Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2<BR>Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each.</P>
<P>The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly<BR>declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal<BR>effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping<BR>Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's<BR>inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the<BR>reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.</P>
<P>By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They are<BR>still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments<BR>like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each<BR>(Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L)<BR>Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and<BR>email on the official document from United Nations' office in London<BR>where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is<BR>still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your<BR>full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-check and see if it<BR>corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left for<BR>you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate<BR>it back to UK (place of origin) as we were instructed.</P>
<P>As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most<BR>importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for<BR>the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s),<BR>etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this<BR>packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial<BR>gratification). You can either come in person or you engage the services<BR>of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the<BR>necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your<BR>doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee<BR>that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project.</P>
