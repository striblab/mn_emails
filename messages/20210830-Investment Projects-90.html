Hello there,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits especially during 
this challenging time of coronavirus pandemic. I hope you and 
your family are well and keeping safe. Anyway, I am Craig 
Johnston, a broker working with Silkroad Fund Managers. I am 
contacting you because one of my high profile clients is 
interested in investing abroad and has asked me to look for 
individuals and companies with interesting business ideas and 
companies that he can invest in. He wants to expand his portfolio 
and has an interest in investing a very substantial amount 
abroad. I got your email contact through an online business 
directory and I thought I'd contact you to see if you are 
interested in this opportunity. Do you or your company have new 
or existing projects that requires funding?

Please indicate your interest by replying back to this email. 
Once I get your response, I will give you more details and we can 
plan a strategy that will be beneficial to all parties.

Best Regards,
D C Johnston
Silkroad Fund Managers
