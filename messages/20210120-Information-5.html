Hi,

I’m not military or ex military, but I am a patriot.  I saw Stewart Rhodes interview on Alex Jones show and I liked what he had to say about coming together to protect each other from secret police and not complying with unconstitutional laws and orders.  I live in Dayton, MN.  I may know some people that I could band together with.  I don’t own a weapon other than a bb gun at this point, or have any training.  In 1776, I would have been the inexperienced farmer who simply had the will to stand up for what was right.

What should I do?  Where can I learn?  Who should I connect with?

Thank you
Aaron Giese
