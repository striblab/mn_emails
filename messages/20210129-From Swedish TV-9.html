Hi Minnesota Oath Keepers,

My name is Alexa and I’m a producer with Swedish National Broadcasting.

Just like everyone else these days, Scandinavians are intrigued by American patriots. Although we understand that the ideological spectrum varies widely, it seems that you’re united in your desire to protect US citizens against a tyrannical federal government. 

We at Swedish TV are interested in knowing more about Oath Keepers. What do you stand for? What are your objectives? Honestly, the news coming out of the U.S. isn’t too great, as you know.

We have a team from Stockholm, Sweden, in the United States who’d like to meet with one (or more) of your members for an interview, share the Oath Keepers’ perspective about America, give the chance to tell viewers in Europe what you’re about. We are European media, so we’re not picking sides.

Would you be interested?

Our team, correspondent Stefan Asberg &amp; videographer Pelle Sterner, can travel anywhere — next week (week of Jan. 31st).

Please let me know.

Looking forward to hearing from you. Happy to speak to anyone to explain more — 703-577-3812.
